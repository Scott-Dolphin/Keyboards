This is my first attempt at a higher level build. I'll be using the Orange Boy Ergo, a budget alice-layout board. It features a plateless design and requires soldering, so This will be a first for me. I'll be using the provided build guide and I'll try to keep a changelog up to date just to document my progress. I'm going for a cat-themed keyboard, hence the name "nekoboard".
